# Fake Review Detector for German E-Commerce 🛍️🇩🇪

This project is a machine learning-based solution to detect fake reviews in German-language e-commerce platforms, specifically using NLP techniques on Amazon.de reviews.

## 📌 Project Summary
The system takes user reviews as input and classifies them as **fake** or **genuine**, with additional explainability using **SHAP** values. The focus is on:
- German-language NLP preprocessing
- Rule-based labeling due to lack of ground truth
- Model building with Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Explainability and transparency via SHAP
